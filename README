1. install software: make gcc-c++ mysql-devel mysql-server curl-devel GeoIP mysql++-3.1.0
2. config the seeder
for example the config file:
ROLE:0
PEERNO:2
SORT:0
this means it works as seeder. the PEERNO and SORT are useless when it works as seeder.

another config file "peers":
192.168.1.2:8001
192.168.1.2:8002
192.168.1.2:8003
192.168.1.2:8004
this means this seeder has 4 peers. these 4 peers will be sent to the leecher.

ROLE:1
PEERNO:2
SORT:0
this means it works as leecher. it will download content from 2 peers. and select these 2 peers by geo-location score.

3.compile the code
4.put the target file to the folder "send"
5. run the seeder ./swift -f ./send/ScottKim_2008.mp4 -l 0.0.0.0:8000

6. run the leecher ./swift -h 66b9644bb01eaad09269354df00172c8a924773b -t localhost:8000 -f 2.mp4

-------------------------------------
it works like this. 
all the seeders are working.
first leecher connected to the 192.168.1.2:8000.
then the seeder sent the 4 peers to leecher.
finally, the leecher will selected 2 of them to download content.
